**Architecture**:

Frontend Layer:

- Next.js Framework: The project is built using Next.js, a React-based framework
  for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated (SSG) web applications.
- Pages: Next.js follows a page-based routing system, where each React component
  in the pages directory corresponds to a route in the application.
- Components: Reusable UI components are organized in the components directory
  facilitating modularity and code reusability.
- Styling: CSS stylesheets or CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled Components are used
  for styling components and pages.


***APIs and Endpoint***

Currently, the portfolio project itself does not utilize any APIs or endpoints. However, the projects showcased within the portfolio make use of various APIs accessed through different endpoints.

**Databases and cloud used:**

- PostgreSQL
- SQL
- MongoDB
- AWS
- 


**Testing**:

- Tools: Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing React components.
= End-to-End Testing: Utilize Cypress for end-to-end testing to simulate user
  interactions.
- CI/CD: Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration, automating tests on
  each commit.
- Best Practices: Follow testing library methodologies, emphasizing user behavior
  testing and mocking/stubbing for reliable results.
